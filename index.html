                                I’ve always had the dream of one day becoming successful. As a little girl, I had a vision that I still have now as an adult, of what I would be when I grew up. I would be dressed in a nice suit, with my coffee and briefcase, driving a fancy car downtown to a beautiful tall building and I’d go up to my office on the 40th floor, sit at my desk covered with a computer, phone, papers, plaques and pictures of my children.  Now that I’m older, I plan on making that dream a reality. Not yet having a career field chosen, I know that it will involve me helping people. I consider myself to be a people person because I get along well with others and I can work well with a team. I’m also a very caring and hardworking individual. As an improving professional, I plan to continue utilizing my skills to help me grow personally and in whatever career field I choose.
                                In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music and spending time with my children. I also like to try out different things to cook when I’m able to take my time and concentrate just in case I have to do it a few times. Another hobby of mine is writing, I’ve always dreamt of one day writing a book or two, hopefully I’ll make that dream come true too. </p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/angel.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Angel G. Gonzalez is a class 11student at Year UP Chicago where he grew an interest in technology, business, and marketing. He was born in Puebla, Mexico in 1990 and migrated to the United States of America in 1994. Growing up in a different environment was a true challenge, but like every challenge it must be concur and master. Angel moved a lot in his younger stage from New York City to Chicago. Adapting to a new environment and always facing a new challenge wherever he goes, made him hungry and ambitious for the next challenge. It gave him an edge to succeed in the cold hard world.
                            Year Up gave Angel the drive and support to succeed in the technology industry. The tools that he learned were hardware, software, coding and communication skills. It was something new and something that really caught his eye. Year Up Chicago was a life changer for Angel because it gave him discipline and the blue print to succeed in what he likes technology. He then found out about Network security and that’s where Angel’s journey began because he realizes he could help people stop getting hacked and robbed of their identity. He started out by actually understanding the roots of network security and it expanded his horizon into software development and coding. That’s where Angel made his first website and found out he was a natural. Then Angel started to build websites projects outside Year Up and started his business in marketing. 
                            Angel has grown and developed some good habits like getting up as early as 5 A.M, dressing professionally, and showing leadership. He’s still the same Angel, but more professional and his hobbies are playing video games and getting the high score, teaching people the basics of a computer, reading comic books, playing sports with anybody that wants to challenge him to a game, making websites for Startup Companies or for the fun of it, and always learning about new technology to keep his mind sharp and on the edge. The word success was engraved into Angel’s mind since he was young. He was brought into the world to make a difference and to make his family proud. Throughout his journey Angel has learned to always seek more then what’s expected and to never be ordinary just be extraordinary. All you need is motivation and consistency to reach your goal.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/phil.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>My name is Phillip Collins and I am a nineteen year old from Chicago Illinois. I’m currently a Year Up student in Chicago which is a twelve month institution that trains young individuals to become professionals in the workforce and expand their desires of computer IT into an actual career. Before joining Year Up, I had completed a year in college attending Western Illinois University in Macomb Illinois, where I studied Law Enforcement Justice Administration and minored in Homeland Security. After completing my first year, I began to deal with financial and family issues which lead me to come home and focus on my passion of IT to focus on a much successful career for me.
                            During my teen years, I began to integrate with computers and sign up for optional technology classes that my high school was offering at the time because while I grew an interest for it, my mother was highly technical with software applications and troubleshooting computers as well. I starting getting familiarized with Microsoft word, excel, power point, and learning the basics of troubleshooting networks connections.  Doing the Year Up program was a tremendous opportunity for me to take not only for the reasons of what I was going to do after coming home, but to master my IT skills that I’ve had already became accustomed to and to learn a lot more.
                            Currently while I’m still completing the program I am working towards my Microsoft Excel Expert certification which essentially allows for me to become advanced in learning how different structures of cells work in excel and manipulating the application where my work in excel is more faster and efficient. I’m also working towards IT Infrastructure certification which allows me to be introduce to not only the software side of technology but also the hardware side of it as well. In the future, I plan on earning my degree Information Systems and building my professional horizon.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/prince.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>I am an open to learn individual and a progressing leader. I am learning and developing skills in coding and hardware repair and troubleshooting. I am pursuing my Nano-degree with an online course called Udacity. I try to keep myself busy all the time and I love conversation with different people. Some of my hobbies consist of designing visual art. I am a perfectionist I think because, I have a huge passion for art. I design t-shirts as well I design with adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator. I have experience with airbrushing as well as graffiti. My artistic background merged with my proficient knowledge on front-end web development, HTML, and CSS gives me the unique perspective that other professionals may not have the advantage of. After completing my course with Udacity and obtaining my CompTIA A+ Certification I plan to obtain my   Bachelor of Science degree in Graphic design and then continue my education at a 4-year University. I will remain persistent in reaching my professional and personal goals so that I’m equipped with essential skills to provide quality services. I give good advice when needed. One of my attributes is giving and receiving feedback. Feedback is important to me because it makes communication with someone effective and clear. .</p>
